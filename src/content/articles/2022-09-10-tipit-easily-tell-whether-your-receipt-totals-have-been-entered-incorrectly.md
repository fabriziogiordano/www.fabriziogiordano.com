I used to reconcile my credit card statements at the end of the month. I was making sure charges were valid and that restaurant and bar charges weren't padded with extra unauthorized tips. I've caught instances of my receipts not matching. It can be for honest mistakes when entering the total amount at the end of the shift or pure disonesty. I like to think all surcharges were simply mistakes.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

So say the number 8778 is a palidrime you can read it forward and backward.

[TipiT](https://tipit.web.app) is a webapp that help you set a tip so that the total is a palindrome.

Example: Suppose your bill is $10.00 and you leave a 20% tip. Your total would be $12.00 ($10 plus $2 tip). Now suppose the bar tender makes a typo and charge you $10 initially and close the tab for $14.
