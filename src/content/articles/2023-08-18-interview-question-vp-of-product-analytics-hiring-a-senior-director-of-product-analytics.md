You are a **VP of Product Analytics** at a big company. Your goal is to hire a **Senior Director of Product Analytics**. What are the questions you'd ask to assess the candidate?

### Technical and Analytical Skills

1. **How do you handle missing or dirty data?**  
   *Answer:* I always start with a thorough data audit to identify inconsistencies. For missing values, depending on the nature and extent, I might use imputation, exclude the affected records, or consult with data engineering for a solution. For dirty data, root cause analysis is essential to prevent future issues.

2. **Can you explain a complex analytical concept in simple terms, say, a multi-touch attribution model?**  
   *Answer:* Sure, imagine you're selling a product. The customer didn't just hear about it once and buy. They might have seen an ad, read a blog, and then clicked an email link. Multi-touch attribution is about figuring out which of those steps had the most influence in the purchase decision.

3. **Describe a challenging technical problem you’ve faced in analytics and how you overcame it.**  
   *Answer:* At my last job, we had an issue with session stitching for our mobile app. The IDs weren't matching consistently. We had to deep dive into the SDK implementation and work closely with our engineering team to rectify it. It was complex but taught us the importance of thorough QA.

### Leadership and Team Management

1. **How do you ensure your team stays current with the latest analytics tools and methodologies?**  
   *Answer:* I allocate budget and time for continuous training. Whether it's online courses, workshops, or conferences, I believe in investing in the team's growth.

2. **Tell me about a time you had to manage conflict within your team.**  
   *Answer:* Once, two of my analysts disagreed on a methodology for a project. I arranged a meeting where each presented their approach. We then debated the merits and drawbacks of each, leading to a hybrid solution that combined the strengths of both.

3. **How do you prioritize tasks and projects for your team, especially when resources are tight?**  
   *Answer:* Prioritization is aligned with the company’s strategic objectives. I work closely with stakeholders to understand the business impact and ensure that our work aligns with the highest ROI activities.

### Strategic and Business Acumen

1. **How do you define and measure product success?**  
   *Answer:* Product success is a blend of user satisfaction, engagement, and financial metrics. We use a mix of qualitative feedback, behavioral analytics, and ROI calculations.

2. **Describe a time when your insights led to a pivot in product strategy.**  
   *Answer:* Our analysis once revealed that a feature, while popular, was cannibalizing revenue from a more profitable feature. Based on this, we decided to redesign our UI, which led to a 25% uptick in overall profitability.

3. **In a fast-paced environment, how do you ensure data accuracy while delivering insights quickly?**  
   *Answer:* It's about balance. We use automated testing and predefined data checks to ensure data integrity. However, when time is of the essence, we prioritize key metrics and ensure stakeholders understand any assumptions or limitations in the analysis.

### Collaboration and Communication

1. **How do you handle disagreements with product managers or other stakeholders regarding data interpretation?**  
   *Answer:* Open dialogue is crucial. I'd present the data, walk through the analysis, and actively listen to their perspective. We find common ground through collaborative discussions.

2. **How do you ensure clear communication and understanding of your team's findings to non-analytical stakeholders?**  
   *Answer:* I believe in visual storytelling and simplifying complex data into digestible insights. We also use analogies and real-world examples to drive the message home.

3. **Describe how you've fostered collaboration between the analytics team and another department.**  
   *Answer:* I initiated "Data Days" with our marketing team. It was a bi-monthly workshop where we'd deep dive into metrics, co-create dashboards, and brainstorm experiments. This fostered a sense of joint ownership and improved collaboration.

These questions touch on both the tactical and strategic responsibilities of a Senior Director of Product Analytics. Their responses should give a well-rounded view of their expertise and approach to the role.
