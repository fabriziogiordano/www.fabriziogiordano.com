This concept shows how a coffee shop ☕️ can use AI to analyze baristas and customers.
As a shop owner, knowing how your shop is doing is very important for the success of your business. AI can allow to know how efficient are your employees. Or how long customer stay in your establishment and in which part of the store in case you want to do a remodel.

There are plenty of other uses cases. The interesting part is that the technology that does this type of tracking can run on modest computer as well making it pretty accessible or relatively low cost.

There are privacy and ethical questions here tho.

What do you think?
