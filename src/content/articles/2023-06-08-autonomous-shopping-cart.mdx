### Autonomous shopping cart

Imagine if after unloading the groceries to your car, there's no need to return the shopping cart. It autonomously navigates its way back to the docking station, ready for the next customer.

Or imagine a trip to Costco or a large-scale store where upon arrival, you no longer have to search for a shopping cart. Instead, your mobile app connects you to an autonomous shopping cart waiting in a specially designated area. Using advanced sensor technology, this smart cart starts to follow you around the store at a safe distance, avoiding obstacles and other shoppers, while you focus on selecting your items.

As you pick your groceries or other items off the shelves, you place them into the cart. Each item is automatically scanned and added to your digital shopping list via RFID or similar technology. The cart also doubles as a smart assistant, suggesting recipes based on the items you've picked or reminding you of anything you might have forgotten.

When you've finished shopping, checking out is just as seamless. Instead of having to unload your items at the cashier, you simply confirm your digital shopping list on your mobile app and pay digitally. The cart can also offer a biometric payment option, where you just scan a card or your fingerprint.

The integration of automation and IoT technologies into the shopping experience not only enhances customer convenience but also promotes efficient use of resources and improves the shopping experience overall. Would this futuristic shopping experience appeal to you? Would you be inclined to use it?
