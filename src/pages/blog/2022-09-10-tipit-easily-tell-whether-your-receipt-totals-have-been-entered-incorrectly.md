I used to reconcile my credit card statements at the end of the month, making sure charges were valid and that restaurant and bar charges weren't padded with extra unauthorized tips. I've caught several instances of my receipts not matching. It can be for honest miskes when entering the total amount at the end of the shift or pure disonesty. I like to think all surcharges were simply mistakes.

With TipiT, reconciling restaurant and bar charges can be done easily. You only have to investigate suspicious looking charges, which should rarely occur.
